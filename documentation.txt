# run "go get -u github.com/hajimehoshi/ebiten/v2"  for installing  the Ebitengine and import it.

# in the (linux ) system install the X11 Development Libraries  for graphical rendering with "sudo apt-get install -y libx11-dev libxi-dev libxcursor-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxxf86vm-dev".

# OpenGL Development Libraries with " sudo apt-get install libgl1-mesa-dev".

Compile to WebAssembly: You need to build your Go code to WebAssembly (WASM). Run the following command in your project directory:

bash
Copy code
GOOS=js GOARCH=wasm go build -o your_game.wasm
This will create the your_game.wasm file.

Copy the wasm_exec.js file: You need the wasm_exec.js file to handle the WebAssembly execution in the browser. This file is usually located in your Go installation under $(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/. Copy it to your project directory. Hereâ€™s how:

bash
Copy code
cp $(go env GOROOT)/misc/wasm/wasm_exec.js .
Serve your files: You can start a simple HTTP server to serve your files. If you have Python installed, you can use the following command:

bash
Copy code
python3 -m http.server
or for Python 2:

bash
Copy code
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
Open the web browser: Go to http://localhost:8000 in your web browser. Make sure your index.html file is properly set up to load your_game.wasm and wasm_exec.js. Here's a basic example of how your index.html might look:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <title>Your Game</title>
    <script src="wasm_exec.js"></script>
    <script>
        const go = new Go();
        WebAssembly.instantiateStreaming(fetch("your_game.wasm"), go.importObject).then(result => {
            go.run(result.instance);
        });
    </script>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Your Game</h1>
</body>
</html>
Play your game: Once everything is set up, your game should run in the browser.
